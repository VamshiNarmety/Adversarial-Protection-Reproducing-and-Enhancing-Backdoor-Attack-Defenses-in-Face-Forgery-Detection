# Adversarial-Protection-Reproducing-and-Enhancing-Backdoor-Attack-Defenses-in-Face-Forgery-Detection
  This project reproduces the backdoor attacks on models trained to detect face forgeries, examining how these attacks impact the model's ability to distinguish between real and fake faces.
  The project also explores defense mechanism to identify and neutralize these attacks without comprimising the model's performance
